# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run :

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

###Step 1: Create a new file named Dockerfile in the root of your project

Dockerfile :
```bash
# Use an official Node.js 14 image as a base
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the package*.json files
COPY package*.json./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY..

# Expose the port the app will use
EXPOSE 3000

# Run the command to start the development server
CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
```


###Step 2: Build the Docker image

Open a terminal in the root of your project and run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t my-react-app.
```

###Step 3: Run the Docker container

To run the Docker container, use the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-react-app
```


This will start a new container from the 'my-react-app' image and map port 3000 on the host machine to port 3000 in the container.

That's it! You now have a Dockerized React.js application using Node.js and npm.

Note: Make sure to replace 'my-react-app' with the desired name for your Docker image.
